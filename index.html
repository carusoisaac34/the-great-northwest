      <div class="AccordionPanelContent">
        <p>The space needle in Seattle, Washington stands 605 feet  tall. Its tallest point is the legacy light which is lit for special occasions.  Its brilliant skyward beam has marked every milestone since 2000. Amazingly,  there is a restaurant at the top of the Space Needle, which slowly gives  customers a view of the entire city. It takes a person 848 steps to reach the  top, but luckily there is also an elevator to speed up the process.</p>

        <p>The Hoh Rainforest is located on the Olympic Peninsula in  western Washington. It is one of the largest temperate rainforests in the U.S.  The Hoh Rainforest is in the Olympic National Park. Annually, the rainforest  gets about 140 to 170 inches of precipitation. The result is a lush, green  canopy of both coniferous and deciduous species. Mosses and ferns that blanket  the surfaces add another dimension to the enchanting qualities of the  rainforest.</p>
